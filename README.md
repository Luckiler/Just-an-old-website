# Just an old website
It's just an old website. Or is it?

This is a website project in wich the user "stumbles" upon what seems to be an useless click-counter website.
Later the site "breaks" and the user needs to adventure himself on what's left of it in order to "repair" him.

It is a super dynamic website destined to procrastinate and to have kind of a phylosophical journey (i'll see if that holds).

For now it is powered by html/css/javascript.



<i>Inspired by numerous websites of this genre that we can find on the interwebs</i>
